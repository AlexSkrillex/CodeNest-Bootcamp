# CodeNest Bootcamp - Collaborative Workspace

Welcome to our collaborative repository for the CodeNest Bootcamp!

## About This Repository

This space is dedicated to all the projects, assignments, and learning materials we'll be working on throughout the CodeNest Bootcamp. It's a place for us, the students, to:

- Submit our individual and group work.
- Share resources and insights.
- Learn and grow together as aspiring developers.

We're excited to embark on this coding journey with our fellow classmates at CodeNest!

## Structure

As we progress through the bootcamp, we'll organize our submissions here. Please try to follow any agreed-upon naming conventions or folder structures to keep things tidy.

## Collaboration

This is a shared space for learning. Let's support each other, provide constructive feedback, and make this a productive and positive environment for everyone involved in the CodeNest Bootcamp.

Happy coding!
